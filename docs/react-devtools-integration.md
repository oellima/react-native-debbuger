# React DevTools Integration

**_NOTE_** Supported React Native version is `>= 0.62`. Please downgrade RNDebugger version to `0.10` if you're using older versions of React Native.

The [React DevTools](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#react-developer-tools) is built by [`facebook/react/packages/react-devtools-core`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-devtools-core).

It will open a WebSocket server to waiting React Native connection. The connection is already included in React Native (see [`setUpReactDevTools.js`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/0.62-stable/Libraries/Core/setUpReactDevTools.js)), it will keep trying to connect the React DevTools server in development mode, it should work well without any specification.

We made the server listen to a random port and inject `window.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_PORT__` global variable in debugger worker.

For Android, we have the built-in `adb` util and it will reverse the port automatically.

## Get `$r` global variable of React Native runtime in the console

Refer to [`Debugger Integration`](debugger-integration.md#debugging-tips).

## **_Question_**: I got `Unsupported` message from React DevTools

If you're using React Native version >= 0.62 and keep React Native Debugger as the latest version, here is what you can do:

In your app project, make sure the `react-devtools-core` dependency to match the React DevTools version. Add resolutions in your `package.json` for Yarn:

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "react-devtools-core": "~4.28.0"
  }
}
```

or NPM:

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "react-devtools-core": "~4.28.0"
  }
}
```

Reference: [Unsupported DevTools backend version - # React Native Debugger](https://gist.github.com/bvaughn/4bc90775530873fdf8e7ade4a039e579#react-native-debugger)

If the React Native version of your project doesn't support `react-devtools-core@4.25`, please consider downgrade React Native Debugger version to v0.12.
